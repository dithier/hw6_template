## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test your work. 

### Important notes

* The code you submit to this lab will be the code that we use for your code walk. 
* Your code **should compile and run** on the Khoury machines during code walks. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we evaluate your assignments.
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!** 
* We will pull your lab code at the late submission deadline to use in the code walk.
 
## Discussion questions

1. How good is the provided stringHash function -- are we really getting constant time operations with our hashmap? What is the big O of the insert and remove operations with this hash function for our stock market use case? 



2. Describe the findings from your research about simple hashmap hash functions, which new hash function you decided to use or create, and why you think it is a good choice for our use case. Make sure you talk about the big O in the worst case for your hash function, and that you describe how the hash function works in C. Be sure to describe all the syntax features that are being used in your hash function. You need to know how this code works!




3. In addition, describe why you think the unit test that you've written shows a good worst case for your hash function. 




4. Discuss what "open addressing" is in regards to hash maps and hash tables.
